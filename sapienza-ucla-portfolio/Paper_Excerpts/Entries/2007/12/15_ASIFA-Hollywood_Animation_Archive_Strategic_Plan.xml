    <richText>&#xD;&lt;i&gt;For the Collection Development course (MIAS 240), my final project was a Strategic Plan for the ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive in Burbank.  The purpose of this plan was to provide an overview of the archive&#x2019;s mission, purpose, history and future goals, and to contextualize it within the framework of the broader communities of archives and animation. It set priorities and outlined a feasible timeline in which to accomplish them.&#xD;&#xD;The document is a real working asset to ASIFA-Hollywood, who will use it as a guideline for both internal members and outside agencies that could potentially support its implementation.&#xD;&#xD;Below, I have included the Table of Contents, to give an overview of the plan&#x2019;s structure.  I also included a portion of the Strengths and Weaknesses section that articulates my notion of building &#x201C;archival fans.&#x201D;  Lastly, I included the External Threats and Opportunities section, which showcases how I have learned to synthesize my knowledge of the role of moving image archives in the context of an evolving digital culture.&lt;/i&gt;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
