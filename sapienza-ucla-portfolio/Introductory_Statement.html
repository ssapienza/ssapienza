                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">I wish I could begin this statement by saying that over the past two years, I learned the most from the courses I took in the MIAS program.  I don’t want to disparage the curriculum, which was tremendously useful to me.  But truthfully, a significant portion of my education has come from the conversations I have had with people – fellow students, archivists, faculty advisers, and mentors – that have fueled my thoughts and inspired me towards new ideas in this program.  <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">For example - while completing a project for a class in early 2007, I was talking to Stephen Worth, the Director of the ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive.   By the third quarter of the program, I had begun recording all the interviews I conducted for papers and projects.  At this point, we were finished discussing the project and were just talking.  The subject was how ASIFA is an archive that was created primarily for artists, and how that makes them unique.  Here is a transcript of our conversation:<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">When I entered the program, my ideas about access were fairly simplistic and limited in scope.  As reflected in my statement of purpose for admission to the MIAS program, the primary way I thought about access was in terms of documentary filmmakers.  In my previous career, I was a researcher and producer for documentary films and television shows.  A large part of my job was finding archival and stock footage.  From this vantage point, I noticed the following problems:<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">These problems are still real, and I used my experiences as launching pads in many of my term papers.  But the main problem with the scope of the above issues is that they reflect user problems, not archive problems.  Over time, I realized that the issue of “sticky door” access policies was a much broader one than I had originally surmised, and how those user problems are intimately connected to archive problems.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">Below I’ve listed some key events that started to change the way I thought about access.  A few of these happened at the 2006 AMIA conference in Anchorage.  At the mentor mixer on opening night, I was lucky enough to speak with TWO amazing mentors, Dan Streible and Rick Prelinger.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">Dan provided me with a bit of history on the orphan film movement, and told me about the Orphans symposium.  This was a bit of a revelation to me - the idea of a world where people are excited about amateur voices and images.  How better to diversify the images of a culture than to ask that culture to provide their own images?<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">I had been a loyal follower of Rick Prelinger’s work for some time, especially since I frequently used his Footage books when I worked as a researcher.  To me, these books were a step in the right direction.  They provided a blisteringly comprehensive list of archives with moving image material, which allowed filmmakers to look outside of the network box.  I was surprised to find that Rick was eager to hear about students’ interests and foci in the program, as he feels that the upsurge of graduate programs are a valuable new addition to the moving image archiving field.  He said that some of us should consider becoming what he calls “MetaArchivists,” or those that don’t necessarily work directly with film or video, but promote the use of archives through the writing of critical archival theory across disciplines.   This was an exciting prospect to me, as I had already considered pursuing my PhD to this effect. <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">Later in the conference, I attended a panel discussion entitled “The Old School and New School of Archiving.”  The discussion that ensued during and after that panel brought to light a reality – that there is still a lack of knowledge about what the typical curriculum looks like, and how that might translate into knowledge that an archive could harness by hiring a graduate.  A deeper issue that surfaced was that the “old school” of archivists valued preservation concerns much more than access issues.  Many speakers and panelists that represented the “new school” were asking questions from the other end of the spectrum - how do we open up modes of access for moving image archives?  <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">Rick later encouraged me to attend an event at USC, at which he was delivering the keynote address.  This event is the next key event that shaped my thinking on access.  The theme of the event was “Remixing the Archive,” and the title of his speech was “Remix or Rollover: Archival Paradox in Century 21.”  The speech was slick, entertaining and frighteningly relevant.  It seemed to underscore and reinforce every notion I had about “sticky” access, and how to combat it.  The main idea I took away from this event was the idea of the “archival fan.”  Using the success of the Prelinger Archives as an example, Rick  made the argument that in order to compete with web video giants like YouTube and Google Video, archives will have to find a way to remain relevant in order to stay afloat.  The Internet Archive has done this with the Prelinger collection and others, by creating a community of “fans” that download and remix the footage.  Thinking about access this way, as “a broad spectrum of possible interactions between archives and users,” [1]  was a launching pad for the way I approached access for the rest of my studies.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">As previously mentioned, I worked with the ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive more than once, and this experience definitely shaped my definition of what a moving image archive could be.  By admission, the archive is concerned foremost with providing access to their collections and disseminating large amounts of information.  They are not afraid of digitizing and providing server access, or of the potential wrath of rightsholders, whom they embrace by incorporating them (animation studio executives who sit on or are connected to the Board of Directors).<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">Last summer I worked half time at two archives in the Bay Area, the Pacific Film Archive and the Internet Archive.  At the PFA, I learned how important it is to contextualize collections, by connecting them to their related documentation.  I also learned how to focus outreach efforts to an underused potential community of users - high school and college-level in the humanities and social sciences.  The PFA had received an IMLS grant specifically to target these educators (as opposed to English or Film departments), and it was very beneficial for me to see this process in action.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">In the fall of 2007 I took Steve Mamber’s Issues in Electronic Culture course, which was by far one of my favorite classes in the program.   Our readings concerned the intersections between technology, culture, and archives.  We also completed several lab projects, including a “false photo,” a morph, and the creation of a 3-D cinematic space.  The highlight of the course was on the last day, when Steve showed us his Hitchcock project.  He had received permission from the Academy Library to digitize and create interactive media tools with items from the Hitchcock archives.  The result was incredible - an electronic, interactive archival workspace with which to explore the visual structures, narrative, and aesthetics of Hitchcock’s films.  This is exactly the type of tool that I feel could potentially wrestle archives out of obscurity and into the public’s eye.  <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">I had been somewhat grumpy about having to wait until the 5th quarter of the program to take the Access class, but now I realize that this was actually a boon.  If I’d taken the class during the early part of the program, I would have had a very limited scope.  But by having experienced all of the above events (and many more) before taking the class, I was able to properly synthesize my ideas about access within the context of restoration, technological history, digital culture, and cataloging.   By studying copyright, programming, and distribution outlets in depth, I could approach my arguments on access with a more solid foundation.  It was the perfect MIAS course to end with.<br /></span></p>
