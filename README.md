## This is Professional Stephanie.

I'm the Digital Humanities Archivist at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland, where I focus on archives, digital storytelling, curation, research data, and digital stewardship.

My research leverages digital humanities methods, creative scholarship, and archival standards to enhance the value and discoverability of media collections. This work includes using linked data to recontextualize media collections, raising awareness of post-custodial community archives and endangered media collections, and creatively reusing archival media through digital storytelling and multimodal scholarship. As an affiliate faculty member of UMD's Cinema and Media Studies (CMS) department, I teach a course on digital storytelling using archives. I'm also developing an interest in the education and documentation of obsolete audiovisual media and playback equipment.

Previously, I managed the [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](https://americanarchive.org/about-the-american-archive), overseeing metadata and digitization for 120 public broadcasting stations, with over 2 million inventory records and 40,000 hours of content digitized.

Before moving to DC in 2010, I directed a Getty-funded initiative for Los Angeles Filmforum called *[Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980](https://www.alternativeprojections.com/)*. This project resulted in over 35 oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich web resource, and an exhibition series as part of the Gettyâ€™s Pacific Standard Time initiative. I also served as Managing Director of [iotaCenter](http://iotacenter.org/), a nonprofit film archive specializing in experimental film and abstract animation.

I hold a graduate degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA, where I focused on access to and reuse of archival media, specializing in animation, experimental film, and broadcasting collections. Before graduate school, I spent six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, specializing in sourcing and licensing archival footage and photos. I earned my bachelor's degree in Film and Media Studies from the University of Kansas and currently serve as Vice President of the KU Film and Media Studies Professional Advisory Board. Rock Chalk.

## This is Stephanie the Person.

I spent ten years of my early childhood on Long Island, twelve years of my middle childhood and college years in Kansas City and Lawrence, ten years of my formative adult years in Los Angeles, and have spent the remainder of my adulthood since 2011 in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) region. Although each of these was its own kind of cultural bubble, I believe in bursting bubbles and having a dialogue with those outside of my bubble.

I grew up obsessively reading books and then began obsessively watching films. Sometimes bands or recording artists allow me to [sing in front of people](https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/511163881_10160769136266090_3536348456488456062_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=cc71e4&_nc_ohc=JNYVdByU4nYQ7kNvwHwovap&_nc_oc=AdlZ1BZMSMHEJ1XacMgjyIVejYOHCAAagBN1XDj8ia5UBZxoTbHhE_9B7HlzBeG5Aro&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&_nc_gid=oLNfW3fMsxaSlRVw3z79LA&oh=00_AfcJpSb0-R3-YoK-OQezbc9kzmw8c-OVd2WiVXYvdSaYcg&oe=690AEBE6), sing [on albums](https://stettes.bandcamp.com/album/future-shit), or make [music videos](/video-work). I make furniture and craft art out of upcycled materials, and I occasionally [perform live storytelling](https://www.instagram.com/p/2xU1BnGwRQ/). These are my two dogs, who (unlike me) are natural redheads.
