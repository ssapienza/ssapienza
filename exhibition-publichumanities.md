## Exhibition and Public Humanities ##

I have a history going back 18 years of work in the public humanities. These range from exhibitions and screenings for Los Angeles Filmforum, an alternative film & video exhibition arts nonprofit which I was involved with for ten years, to my current position for which I formerly spearheaded MITH's [Digital Dialogues speaker series](https://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/) for five years, as well as several conferences and special events. Below is only a partial list.
