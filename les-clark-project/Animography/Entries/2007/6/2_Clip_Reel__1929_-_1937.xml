    <richText>In the intro to the Animography on this site, Clark is quoted as saying that it took him and his fellow animators five to seven years to really learn their craft.  This series of clips represents the first eight years of Les&#x2019; career as an animator.  You can see that the movements in his characters become more refined during this time, leading directly into Clark&#x2019;s work on Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.  &#xD;&#xD;Another thing to notice is that Clark frequently animated the finales of short films, which is probably partly why he was dubbed &#x201C;the finisher&#x201D; by his coworkers. </richText>
