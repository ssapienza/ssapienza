                <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">History is replete with examples of self-made histories, and the myriad histories devoted to the Disney studio are a testament to that.  The legacy of the famed “Nine Old Men,” a group of core animators during the early days of the Walt Disney Studio, has been laid down in many publications, interviews and animation lore since Walt dubbed them with the famous moniker around 1950.  Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas were probably the two most famous of the Nine for several reasons, not the least of which was self-promotion.  In 1981, Johnston and Thomas wrote </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_3">The Illusion of Life</span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">, which brought them into the public sphere and branded them as the perennial experts on the studio’s various personalities and overall history.  What is less well known is that reclusive animator Les Clark, one of the Nine, was originally asked by Walt to write the book.  <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">Clark had been the studio’s longest employee, from 1927 to 1975, and so was a natural choice to pen the treatise on its history.  Other reasons may have been that he was a reclusive observer who consistently avoided the limelight, and he was favored by Walt because of his agreeable and relaxed personality.  Animator Art Babbitt, a former coworker of Clark’s on such films as </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_3">Country Cousin</span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"> (1936), told Stephen Worth in an interview that Clark was referred to as “Walt’s Boy” by the other animators.  Whether this nickname was spiteful or purely fraternal is unclear, but it still begs the question of what </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_3">The Illusion of Life</span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"> would have looked like if Walt’s Boy had written it?  <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">Renowned animation historian Mike Barrier is among several writers who have presented a somewhat revisionist argument against the popular notion that the animation of the Nine does not represent the studio’s best output.  These writers stipulate that the wave of animators that came in from New York in the 1930’s, among them Ham Luske, Norm Ferguson, Fred Moore, Art Babbitt, and Bill Tytla, deserve equal credit.  According to Barrier, the designation of the Nine was simply an outcome of the fact that they were the only animators left working at the studio; “in the forties, fifties, and sixties, most of those earlier animators were working elsewhere, if they were still alive. It was the nine who were working for Disney.”<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">There is no doubt Disney has some level of culpability is shaping the myth of the Nine, simply by assigning their moniker, with its overtones of supremacy and power.  But of these Nine, certainly Clark deserves a moment of special credit simply due to the fact that he was present at the studio several years before the New York crew came, and many years after they dispersed.  This kind of longevity breeds an animation career that most clearly represents the progression and refinement of animation styles over the years, regardless of its individual flourishes or superiority.  <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">The goal of this site is not to create a revisionist history about Clark’s work as superior to other animators within or outside the Nine.  It is to present the sequence of animation milestones in Clark’s career as an exemplary representation of the work of a studio with a very “set-in-stone” image in place.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">My research into Clark’s contributions was at times fruitless as well as frustrating, for the very reasons I’ve listed above.  Clark continuously resisted stepping into the limelight and did not call attention to himself, so writers were prone to skipping over him in the popular histories about the studio.  Because of this, my research took a somewhat back-way approach.  I began by examining some of the most iconic books about Disney history.  I had read a few of them in part or in whole, so I had a basic idea of the major developments.  For this reason, I began by looking for references to Clark via the books’ indexes.  This proved somewhat frustrating, as the mentions were brief and mostly connected with broader listings of the Nine.  <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">At some point, I got a hold of three large folders of material on Clark from the John Canemaker Animation collection at NYU.  These contained loads of biographical data, correspondence, and many transcripts of interviews with Clark and his family.  What I found interesting is the number of times I found evidence that Clark was associated with some of the major developments in the studio’s history.  For example - looking through some of the correspondence, Clark is cited numerous times in interviews as being part of the group that provided the homegrown soundtrack for Steamboat Willie.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">Examining these, I began to wonder why Clark not included in the stories about this recording session espoused by some of the popular studio histories:<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">“As soon as animation on </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_4">Steamboat Willie</span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"> was completed, Walt and his colleagues made their first attempt at improving a soundtrack.  One July evening they set up the projector outside the studio window (to minimize noise from the machine, and Roy projected </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_4">Steamboat Willie </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">onto a bed sheet while Walt, Ub, Wilfred Jackson and Johnny Cannon provided music, voices and sound effects.  ‘It was terrible,’ Walt later recalled, ‘but it was wonderful! And it was something new!’” [Richard Holliss and Brian Sibley, </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_3">The Disney Studio Story<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">There has been a renewed interest on the web lately in dissecting archival artifacts like exposure sheets and animation drafts that have trickled out into the public sphere (and out of the tight grasp of the Disney Archives).  The result of this is a new look at exactly what animators were responsible for what iconic pieces of animation.  Sometimes, like the infamous game/metaphor Telephone, stories that pinpoint animators’ work on particular films get passed down and somewhat distorted in the process.  Most of these stories seems to favor members of the Nine Old Men like Thomas, Kimball, and Johnston.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">Mike Barrier, in a critique of John Canemaker’s book </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_3">Walt Disney’s Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation</span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">, says that Clark’s section in the book is padded and masks the fact that he was an inferior animator; “Because Canemaker writes about the Nine as if they were of roughly equal importance, and thus writes about them at roughly equal length, some of his chapters feel padded. This is especially true of the chapters devoted to Les Clark and John Lounsbery, whose work was regarded, correctly, by their fellow &quot;old men&quot; as being on a somewhat lower plane than that of the other seven.”  <br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">In his interview with Stephen Worth, Art Babbitt said (somewhat reluctantly) that Clark’s animation on </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_3">Country Cousin </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">(1936) was just as good as his own.  Michael Mayerson, in reviewing one of the animation drafts that are coming out every day on Hans Perks blog and elsewhere, has said (this time about the 1951 short </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_3">Plutopia</span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">) “I've yet to see anything Les Clark animated that doesn't impress me. Clark gets the initial part of the dream sequence, where the characters' relationships are nailed down. […] This is all personality animation and Clark does a great job of putting the emotions across and establishing the dream's version of the cat.”  As more of these drafts come out, a new history about Clark is emerging.  Not only does his work shine in smaller shorts like </span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_3">Plutopia</span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">, but it helped define some of the most iconic moments in many of the features.  Among many, many other things, Clark animated:<br /></span></p>

It doesn't seem that he was often the lead on a feature character, so he was forced to make his work fit in with other people's ... On the shorts, Clark's characters exude confidence and liveliness. Were those qualities present in his feature work?” If Clark was reluctant to “get the word out” about his contributions, it is now time for someone to try and do that for him.  <br /></span></p>
