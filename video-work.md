# Video Work

Below are some highlights from my work with local musicians: music videos, archival remix pieces, motion-graphics loops for live shows, and longform VJ sets built from a combination of archival sources, animation. My background is in moving image archiving, so I tend to reach for historical and marginal footage, then layer it with bright color, geometric animation, and audio-reactive elements.

## Recent / Featured Work

### Color Palette Collaboration (2025)
For [Color Palette](https://www.colorpalettedc.com/), an indie dream pop band from Washington, DC led by songwriter and vocalist Jay Nemeyer, I created 14 looping projection visuals and two music videos that extend their lush, melodic sound into a visual language of light, motion, and memory. The most recent, *[Zombie](https://youtu.be/ooy9Cz-BiyQ?si=gcH54R_euYRSlJFi)* (2025), is a tribute to classic monster-movie imagery. I also cut together a video for their song *[Grateful](https://youtu.be/yr0B1_mDY5M?si=W_2C1v5tNpdqhLxH)* which features live footage from the January 2025 show with audience-captured footage.

### King of the Moon Collaboration (2025)
A 12-song live performance video set for psychedelic rock duo [King of the Moon](https://custommademusicmag.com/2025/10/just-like-magic-an-interview-with-king-of-the-moon/), a collaboration between Sam Cooper and Michael Stettes. The album was recorded out in Montgomery County’s Agricultural Reserve, where Sam grew up, and that environment shaped a lot of the sound. My job was to translate that sense of space and atmosphere into moving images.

### Mazerrati Star Collaboration (2023–24)
A music video concept album with multidisciplinary artist and musician Skye Handler, for the band Mazerrati Star (formerly Ladygod). Featuring original music by Handler, the piece is a cycle of five videos charting a dark, nonlinear journey across motels and liminal landscapes. I also collaborated with Handler on the album art as well as the album's [Spotify video loops](https://open.spotify.com/album/6vNlH8SslFvDQAXGx0v26u?si=TqXeULp6RGWgHJD9nR1ccA).
